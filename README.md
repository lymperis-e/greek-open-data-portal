Open Greek Geodata
==========

This project aims to provide a centralised hub to preview, inspect and connect to open geospatial data sources & services for Greece. 

Although many organizations in the country federate and provide geospatial information, there is no comprehensive catalog of a majority of available datasets. This is what *OpenGreekGeodata* hopes to achieve.

The beast under the hood is the amazing [TerriaMap](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap/) developed by [CSIRO's Data 61](https://data61.csiro.au/) to support the national geodata portals of Australia. They kindly open-sourced it for the rest of the world to enjoy!
