Open Greek Geodata
==========

# An open geodata portal
This project aims to provide a centralised hub to preview, inspect and connect to open geospatial data sources & services for Greece. 

Although many organizations in the country federate and provide geospatial information, 

The beast under the hood is the awesome [TerriaMap](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap/)


# A federated, organized and centralised catalog
